Ideally we would calculate the best hospitals from the effective_care table,
but I can not figure out how to get MapReduce to work in PySpark. So we will 
just look at surveys_and responses instead.

There are 23 hospitals with a base score of 80 and consistency score of 20,
but we want to know the top 10.  We should figure out some other criteria
as a tie-breaker.
