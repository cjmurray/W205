We calculate the best hospitals based on the average score for procedures from
the Effective_Care table.  Many scores are on a 100-point scale, however some
scores are in the thousands, some appear to be on a 5-point scale, and others
are text values.  To simplify our calculation, we ignore any scores over 100
or less than 1.

Based on these criteria, the 10 best hospitals are as follows:
