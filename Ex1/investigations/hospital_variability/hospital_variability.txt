To determine which procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals,
we calculate the standard deviation of score from the Effective_Care table for
each procedure.  Many scores are on a 100-point scale, however some
scores are in the thousands, some appear to be on a 5-point scale, and others
are text values.  To simplify our calculation, we ignore any scores over 100
or less than 1.

Based on these criteria, the 10 best hospitals are as follows:

StdDev	MeasureID		MeasureName
------- ----------------------- ---------------------------------------------
49.5    IMM_2   		Immunization for influenza                                      
49.5	ED_2b			ED2
47.5	OP_5			Median Time to ECG
47.5	OP_4			Aspirin at Arrival
42.27	OP_22			Left before being seen
42.27	IMM_3_FAC_ADHPCT	Healthcare workers given influenza vaccination
42.27	OP_4			Aspirin at Arrival
42.27	READM_30_HOSP_WIDE	No different than the National Rate
42.27	OP_5			Median Time to ECG
42.20	OP_4			Aspirin at Arrival
